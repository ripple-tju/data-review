محافظة رونغجيانغ بالمقاطعة، وتجولوا في معرض يوثق مسيرة تطور \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" واطلعوا على تفاصيل إقامة المباريات في المحافظة.   يمتاز \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" عن الرياضات الاحترافية بكونه يحتضن لاعبين من مختلف فئات المجتمع، كالبائعين أو السائقين أو الجزارين، وأثناء فترات الراحة بين المباريات يغني القرويون الذين يرتدون الأزياء التقليدية، الأغاني الشعبية ويرقصون، ما يخلق جوا احتفاليا رائعا.   وقد حاز الدوري على اهتمام عالمي متزايد. حتى أبريل عام 2025، زار أكثر من 1200 هاو لكرة القدم من مصر واليمن وغيرهما من أكثر من 50 دولة ومنطقة في العالم محافظة رونغجيانغ، للتفاعل مع الفرق المحلية ومشاهدة المباريات.    أعجبت آمنة المدحي، خبيرة متخصصة بحماية وبحث وإدارة التراث الثقافي في البحرين وتزور الصين لأول مرة، بتطور كرة القدم في محافظة جبلية صغيرة في الصين والحيوية القوية التي تمنحها الرياضة للنمو السياحي والاقتصادي المحلي.    وقالت إن \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" يجمع بين الرياضة والثقافة والسياحة ويجسد طاقات الريف الصيني الكامنة.   ومن جانبه وصف عمار دراز، متخصص في الإعلان من الأردن، محافظة

لاحتمال تنظيم كأس العالم لـ\"دوري السوبر للقرى\" في عام 2028، معبرا عن أمله في مشاركة فرق عراقية في هذه البطولة، بما يعزز التبادل الرياضي بين البلدين.   وأجريت الزيارة خلال الفترة بين يومي 18 و21 مايو، في إطار ندوة حماية وتنمية التراث الثقافي غير المادي للدول العربية التي أقامها المعهد المركزي الصيني لمواهب الثقافة والإدارة السياحية. كما أجرى المشاركون مناقشات مع نظرائهم الصينيين حول سبل حماية

بنسبة 26 في المائةانطلق قطار شحن للنقل السككي-المائي حاملا 100 حاوية قياسية من الأجهزة المنزلية والآلات والسلع الاستهلاكية، صباح يوم الأحد الماضي، من محطة ييوو الغربية للسكك الحديدية، متوجها إلى ميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بشرقي الصين، حيث سيتم شحن البضائع عبر سفينة شحن مباشرة إلى ميناء جبل علي في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة.أفادت شركة شانغهاي المحدودة التابعة لمجموعة السكك الحديدية الصينية أن انطلاق هذا القطار يمثل تدشينا رسميا لنموذج الخدمات اللوجستية الجديد متعدد الوسائط الذي يجمع بين النقل السريع بالقطار من مدينة ييوو التي تعتبر \"سوق العالم للسلع الصغيرة\" وميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بمقاطعة تشجيانغ الساحلية بشرقي البلاد، والملاحة البحرية المباشرة إلى دبي الإماراتية، بما يوفر مسارا أكثر سرعة وكفاءة للتجارة الدولية.وأوضحت الشركة أنه بفضل هذا النموذج الجديد، تم تقليص زمن التوصيل من مركز تجميع البضائع في ييوو إلى نقاط التوزيع النهائية في دبي من 23 يوما إلى 17 يوما، ما يمثل انخفاضا بنحو 26 في المائة، فيما خفض التكاليف اللوجستية بنحو 18 في المائة.وفي هذا السياق، قال تشن سونغ دي، مدير قسم التسويق بمركز لوجستيات السكك الحديدية في هانغتشو التابع للشركة \"في المستقبل، سنعتمد على هذا المسار السريع المزدوج لتوفير خدمات لوجستية عابرة للحدود أكثر كفاءة

This quirky event transformed the field into a cozy haven of blankets and pillows, as participants competed to nap like champions, highlighting South Korea’s growing focus on sleep awareness. While specific details like rules or winners are still emerging due to the event’s recency, its purpose was to advocate for rest in a nation where sleep is scarce. South Korea ranks 50th out of 57 markets for sleep habits, according to the IKEA Sleep Report 2025, with citizens averaging just 6 hours and 27 minutes nightly—far below the recommended 7-9 hours. Long work hours and long commutes chip away at rest, making events like this vital. These events turn rest into a public spectacle, blending humor with a serious message: sleep matters. In a culture where hustle overshadows health, napping on a sports field isn’t just fun—it’s a bold statement. South Korea’s sleep debt impacts everything from student performance to overall wellness, and this event, filled with cozy setups and determined snoozers, showed that rest can be celebrated. From eye masks to dreamy expressions, the participants proved napping is a skill worth mastering. So, let’s take a cue from these sleep warriors and prioritize rest. #NapCompetition #SleepHard #ChosunUniversity #SleepWell #SouthKorea #Sleep #Nap #Health","url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalTVNetwork/posts/pfbid0WMpt2a7a8tDLSyumc4jKBCyYTUd7Zaum2ca7WoKkKmsjTS3ESStbeWLZqmex67Syl","index":{"like":57,"comment":0,"share":4,"read":null,"favorite":null},"author":{"id":"100044504436603","name":"CGTN"}},{"id":"1362158058610996","capturedAt":"2025-05-26T04:11:22.000Z","createdAt":"2025-05-21T20:41:29.000Z","content":"Foreign diplomats from over 20 countries, including the UK, France and China came under Israeli fire on an official West Bank visit.The group was visiting a refugee camp in the Palestinian city of Jenin.Israeli military said \"soldiers operating in the area fired warning shots to distance them away,” but added that it \"regrets the inconvenience caused.”The Palestinian Authority's Foreign Ministry said the delegation was on an official mission to “observe and assess the humanitarian situation and document the ongoing violations perpetrated” by Israel.

الرياضة الريفية والتكامل بين الرياضة والسياحة الثقافية في المقاطعة.   وخلال الزيارة، شاهد المشاركون مباراة كرة القدم ضمن \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" المعروف اختصارا في اللغة الصينية باسم \"تسون تشاو\" في محافظة رونغجيانغ بالمقاطعة، وتجولوا في معرض يوثق مسيرة تطور \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" واطلعوا على تفاصيل إقامة المباريات في المحافظة.   يمتاز \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" عن الرياضات الاحترافية بكونه يحتضن لاعبين من مختلف فئات المجتمع، كالبائعين أو السائقين أو الجزارين، وأثناء فترات الراحة بين المباريات يغني القرويون الذين يرتدون الأزياء التقليدية، الأغاني الشعبية ويرقصون، ما يخلق جوا احتفاليا رائعا.   وقد حاز الدوري على اهتمام عالمي متزايد. حتى أبريل عام 2025، زار أكثر من 1200 هاو لكرة القدم من مصر واليمن وغيرهما من أكثر من 50 دولة ومنطقة في العالم محافظة رونغجيانغ، للتفاعل مع الفرق المحلية ومشاهدة

للنمو السياحي والاقتصادي المحلي.    وقالت إن \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" يجمع بين الرياضة والثقافة والسياحة ويجسد طاقات الريف الصيني الكامنة.   ومن جانبه وصف عمار دراز، متخصص في الإعلان من الأردن، محافظة

مايو، في إطار ندوة حماية وتنمية التراث الثقافي غير المادي للدول العربية التي أقامها المعهد المركزي الصيني لمواهب الثقافة والإدارة السياحية. كما أجرى المشاركون مناقشات مع نظرائهم الصينيين حول سبل حماية

بنسبة 26 في المائةانطلق قطار شحن للنقل السككي-المائي حاملا 100 حاوية قياسية من الأجهزة المنزلية والآلات والسلع الاستهلاكية، صباح يوم الأحد الماضي، من محطة ييوو الغربية للسكك الحديدية، متوجها إلى ميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بشرقي الصين، حيث سيتم شحن البضائع عبر سفينة شحن مباشرة إلى ميناء جبل علي في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة.أفادت شركة شانغهاي المحدودة التابعة لمجموعة السكك الحديدية الصينية أن انطلاق هذا القطار يمثل تدشينا رسميا لنموذج الخدمات اللوجستية الجديد متعدد الوسائط الذي يجمع بين النقل السريع بالقطار من مدينة ييوو التي تعتبر \"سوق العالم للسلع الصغيرة\" وميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بمقاطعة تشجيانغ الساحلية بشرقي البلاد، والملاحة البحرية المباشرة إلى دبي الإماراتية، بما يوفر مسارا أكثر سرعة وكفاءة للتجارة الدولية.وأوضحت الشركة أنه بفضل هذا النموذج الجديد، تم تقليص زمن التوصيل من مركز تجميع البضائع في ييوو إلى نقاط التوزيع النهائية في دبي من 23 يوما إلى 17 يوما، ما يمثل انخفاضا بنحو 26 في المائة، فيما خفض التكاليف اللوجستية بنحو 18 في المائة.وفي هذا السياق، قال تشن سونغ دي، مدير قسم التسويق بمركز لوجستيات السكك الحديدية في هانغتشو التابع للشركة \"في المستقبل، سنعتمد على هذا المسار السريع المزدوج لتوفير خدمات لوجستية عابرة للحدود أكثر كفاءة

في جنوب غربي الصينزار أكثر من 30 مسؤولا وخبيرا وفنانا مهنيا من قطاعي السياحة والثقافة وغيرهما من مصر والأردن والبحرين والعراق وفلسطين، مقاطعة قويتشو في جنوب غربي الصين، حيث تعرفوا بشكل عميق على تنمية الرياضة الريفية والتكامل بين الرياضة والسياحة الثقافية في المقاطعة.   وخلال الزيارة، شاهد المشاركون مباراة كرة القدم ضمن \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" المعروف اختصارا في اللغة الصينية باسم \"تسون تشاو\" في محافظة رونغجيانغ بالمقاطعة، وتجولوا في معرض يوثق مسيرة تطور \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" واطلعوا على تفاصيل إقامة المباريات في المحافظة.   يمتاز \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" عن الرياضات الاحترافية بكونه يحتضن لاعبين من مختلف فئات المجتمع، كالبائعين أو السائقين أو الجزارين، وأثناء فترات الراحة بين المباريات يغني القرويون الذين يرتدون الأزياء التقليدية، الأغاني الشعبية ويرقصون، ما يخلق جوا احتفاليا رائعا.   وقد حاز الدوري على اهتمام عالمي متزايد. حتى أبريل عام 2025، زار أكثر من 1200 هاو لكرة القدم من مصر واليمن وغيرهما من أكثر من 50 دولة ومنطقة في العالم محافظة رونغجيانغ، للتفاعل مع الفرق المحلية ومشاهدة المباريات.    أعجبت آمنة المدحي، خبيرة متخصصة بحماية وبحث وإدارة التراث الثقافي في البحرين وتزور الصين لأول مرة، بتطور كرة القدم في محافظة جبلية صغيرة في الصين والحيوية القوية التي تمنحها الرياضة للنمو السياحي والاقتصادي المحلي.    وقالت إن \"دوري السوبر للقرى\" يجمع بين الرياضة والثقافة والسياحة ويجسد طاقات الريف الصيني الكامنة.   ومن جانبه وصف عمار دراز، متخصص في الإعلان من الأردن، محافظة رونغجيانغ بأنها \"محافظة كرة القدم\"، مشيرا إلى الحماس الكبير لدى سكانها لهذه الرياضة، إلى جانب توفر بنية تحتية متخصصة تخدم اللاعبين والهواة.    أما أحمد عبود، مراسل ومصور صحفي عراقي، فقد أبدى حماسه لاحتمال تنظيم كأس العالم لـ\"دوري السوبر للقرى\" في عام 2028، معبرا عن أمله في مشاركة فرق عراقية في هذه البطولة، بما يعزز التبادل الرياضي بين البلدين.   وأجريت الزيارة خلال الفترة بين يومي 18 و21 مايو، في إطار ندوة حماية وتنمية التراث الثقافي غير المادي للدول العربية التي أقامها المعهد المركزي الصيني لمواهب الثقافة والإدارة السياحية. كما أجرى المشاركون مناقشات مع نظرائهم الصينيين حول سبل حماية التراث الثقافي غير المادي في الصين وتوريثه وتنميته المبتكرة، فضلا عن آفاق الحوار الحضاري بين الصين والدول العربية.","url":"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02iV2hJoESA8vRXTykJ6qgXujBKY5ww2gRejh9xLmfzeQSWaW3KWvwKiDaB5jzLxc7l&id=100066795714284","index":{"like":23,"comment":0,"share":1,"read":null,"favorite":null},"author":{"id":"100066795714284","name":"China

بنسبة 26 في المائةانطلق قطار شحن للنقل السككي-المائي حاملا 100 حاوية قياسية من الأجهزة المنزلية والآلات والسلع الاستهلاكية، صباح يوم الأحد الماضي، من محطة ييوو الغربية للسكك الحديدية، متوجها إلى ميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بشرقي الصين، حيث سيتم شحن البضائع عبر سفينة شحن مباشرة إلى ميناء جبل علي في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة.أفادت شركة شانغهاي المحدودة التابعة لمجموعة السكك الحديدية الصينية أن انطلاق هذا القطار يمثل تدشينا رسميا لنموذج الخدمات اللوجستية الجديد متعدد الوسائط الذي يجمع بين النقل السريع بالقطار من مدينة ييوو التي تعتبر \"سوق العالم للسلع الصغيرة\" وميناء نينغبوه-تشوشان بمقاطعة تشجيانغ الساحلية بشرقي البلاد، والملاحة البحرية المباشرة إلى دبي الإماراتية، بما يوفر مسارا أكثر سرعة وكفاءة للتجارة الدولية.وأوضحت الشركة أنه بفضل هذا النموذج الجديد، تم تقليص زمن التوصيل من مركز تجميع البضائع في ييوو إلى نقاط التوزيع النهائية في دبي من 23 يوما إلى 17 يوما، ما يمثل انخفاضا بنحو 26 في المائة، فيما خفض التكاليف اللوجستية بنحو 18 في المائة.وفي هذا السياق، قال تشن سونغ دي، مدير قسم التسويق بمركز لوجستيات السكك الحديدية في هانغتشو التابع للشركة \"في المستقبل، سنعتمد على هذا المسار السريع المزدوج لتوفير خدمات لوجستية عابرة للحدود أكثر كفاءة
